##Part1:
-I would like to transform flat artworks into dynamic 3D creations, brimming with spatial depth and ever-evolving visuals. By merging traditional artworks with innovative techniques, I aim to generate a completely fresh design experience. This concept injects new life into classic artworks, presenting them with a unique charm. Through this creative process, we can uncover new dimensions and surprises within art, blending the past with the present to craft astonishing visual effects. It's a way to make viewers feel the continuous evolution and renewal of art, infusing traditional art with a modern vitality.

##Part2:
-This code uses a for loop to draw spheres and applies translations and rotations along the X, Y, and Z axes using sine and cosine functions in each frame. The push() and pop() functions are used to ensure that the transformations of each sphere do not interfere with each other, resulting in a continuous spatial animation.
